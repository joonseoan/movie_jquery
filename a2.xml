			<title poster = "jfk.PNG">JFK</title>
			<description>
				This acclaimed Oliver Stone drama presents the investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy led by New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner). When Garrison begins to doubt conventional thinking on the murder, he faces government resistance, and, after the killing of suspected assassin Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman), he closes the case. Later, however, Garrison reopens the investigation, finding evidence of an extensive conspiracy behind Kennedy's death.

				Truth or not, this is an exceptional piece of cinema, deeply provoking and audacious.
			</review>
			<review>
				"JFK" is a well-made work of suspense, intrigue, and drama, all based on trying to solve one of the greatest mysteries of our time.
			</review>
			<review>
				As speculation, JFK is riveting. As proof, it's bunk.

			<review>
				All the pieces were in place for a refreshing entry in the superhero genre, but Fantastic Four completely unravels at the halfway point.
			</review>
			<review>
				Fantastic Four, despite the dogged efforts of its talented young cast, has nothing.
			</review>
			<review>
				This iteration, directed by Josh Trank (Chronicle) is a dull, sour, claustrophobic mess: 80 minutes of tedious origin story followed by 20 minutes of more-tedious-still climax.

				This improbably magnificent film and Michael Giacchinoâ€™s majestic score are a perfect match. The apes are the good guys here, but the humans who made the movie do our species proud
			</review>
			<review>
				This entry in the series, directed by Matt Reeves, is the grimmest episode so far, and also the strongest, a superb example of clear thinking wedded to inventive technique in popular filmmaking.
			</review>
			<review>
				Director Matt Reeves follows the excellent Dawn of the Planet of the Apes with this even more complex, darker, smarter sequel, which seems destined to resonate longer than a typical popcorn movie.
